## About Dayspring

This is a Django app for tracking and managing [a church choir](http://nationalchurch.org/Praising/Dayspring_Choir). It depends on [django-swingtime](https://github.com/dakrauth/django-swingtime) for creating `Event` and `Occurrence` instances and then ties those into a list of choir members and pieces. A full list of dependencies is in requirements.txt. It is designed to be deployed on Heroku.
